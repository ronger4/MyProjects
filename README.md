Computer Networks 2 Project - Implementaion of client server model. Where the server maintance radio stations that broadcast music. The client intercepts udp packets and plays the music.
several clients can be maintained. Clients can upload new songs and new station is set when a new song is uploaded.

 Final Project(Corn Classification Using Image Processing and Machine Learning) - We classified plants of corn watered with 5 different Irrigation levels.
 In the begining we used image processing in MATLAB to extract features and insert them into CSV file. Next step was reading this CSV file in Python and creating machime     
 learning model. We used LGBM framework that implements Gradiant Boost Decision Tree model. In the end we showed the results.
 
 Langauges: MATLAB and Python
 
 Workspace - MATLAB and Pycharm on Windows 10
